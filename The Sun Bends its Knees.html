The car hummed along softly as it caressed the hard black road top, as it guided
itself down the lane. Two cones of light beaconed through the air from the
vehicles headlights, illuminating a constantly changing view of falling snow;
the wind buffeted against its sleek, aerodynamic body. As it rounded corners
and dipped into curves, it calculated the optimal body shape - quickly but
carefully adjusting panels here and there - to ensure it was always running at
maximum efficiency. The vehicle realized that this was a futile attempt at these
low speeds of public roads, but it still found a sense of joy in keeping its
skills sharped, honed.

Inside the soft murmur of the vehicle and roadway was replaced by - somewhat -
loud electronic music. At least the sole occupant thought it was electronic, of
some sort. In fact, they didn't really know what to call it, but the car seemed
to enjoy the strange tones, seeing as it was the one that picked the music for the
nights drive home.

They stared out across the sea of white and black. It was like watching one of
those old television screens from the more primitive times of technology; they
had done that once, using the worlds interconnected knowledge store to explore
the history of entertainment during the early years. Oh how the world had
changed since then.

<p>
In the seat next to them, thrown on top of a coat like it was an afterthought,
the occupants phone suddenly burst into life. The little rectangle of glass
suddenly turned opaque and light poured from it, nearly as much as the
headlights were putting out, the occupant thought.

32 seconds. Thats how long you could wait before the networks dropped the call.
32 seconds was a long time, at least for someone with Magnetically Accelerated
Computing Engines wrapped around every nerve in their body. 32 more seconds to
stare across the blank night ahead of the vehicle.

<p>
Colloquially called MACE, Magnetically Accelerated Computing Engines were tiny
little machines, nearly intelligent in their own right, which attached
themselves around every nerve in your body. The benefit was amazing fast
thinking, better organization and recall of memories and overall integration
into the wider collection of information that made up "The Net." It also
increased your reaction rates to the near maximum speed afforded by normal
muscles, and heightened your senses and overall perception of the world.
</p>

<p>
Now days MACE was so far advanced - let alone in everyones body in fairly high
concentrations - that people most often choose to live inside of the MACE,
using their biological nerves for longterm memory retention. While, arguably,
the whole population was now walking around as zombie like cyborgs as a result
of using this new artificial brain material, everyone generally considered it
to be a Good Idea, and overall Better This Way.
