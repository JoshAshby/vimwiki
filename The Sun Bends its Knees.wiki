The car humed along softly as it carressed the hard black roadtop, as it guided
itself down the lane. Two cones of light beaconed thru the air from the
vehicles headlights, illuminating a constantly changing view of falling snow;
the wind buffeted against its sleek, aerodynamic body. As it rounded corners
and dipped into curves, it calculated the optimal body shape - quickly but
carefully adjusting panels here and there - to ensure it was always running at
maximum efficency. The vehicle realized that this was a futile attempt at these
low speeds of public roads, but it still found a sense of joy in keeping its
skills sharped, honed.

Inside the soft murmmur of the vehicle and roadway was replaced by - somewhat -
loud electronic music. At least the sole occupant thought it was electronic, of

to enjoy the strange tones, seeing as it was the one that picked the music for the
nights drive home.

They stared out across the sea of white and black. It was like watching one of
those old television screens from the more primative times of technology; they
had done that once, using the worlds interconnected knowledge store to explore
the history of entertainment during the early years. Oh how the world had
changed since then.

the occupants phone suddenly burst into life. The little rectangle of glass
suddenly turned opaque and light poured from it, nearly as much as the
headlights were putting out, the occupant thought.
